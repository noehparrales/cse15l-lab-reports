1. When running the command cd with no argument, it did not do much because it did not contain a directory to go to. As well, since I'm in the terminal home it stayed in home. This did not produce an error.

2. When running the command cd with a pathway to a directory using the argument "lecture1", it changed its directory to the folder of my choice. In doing so, "lecture1" has been added to the terminal, this means that now I can interact with the file systems under the specific directory. This did not produce an error.

3. When running the command cd with a pathway to a file using "Hello.class", it produced an error. This is due to the fact that "Hello.class" is a file and the command cd only works to navigate through directories in the terminal as the output states.
