```
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class h {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        h fileSystem = new h();
        fileSystem.readFromFile("input.txt");
    }

    public void readFromFile(String fileName) {
        try {
            File file = new File(fileName);
            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(file);

            while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {
                String line = scanner.nextLine();
                processLine(line);
            }

            scanner.close();
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            System.out.println("File not found: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    public void processLine(String line) {
        // Simulate processing each line, but introduce a bug
        System.out.println(line + " " + generateMysteriousCharacters());
    }

    public String generateMysteriousCharacters() {
        // Simulate a bug causing unexpected characters
        return "\u001B[31m???\u001B[0m";
    }
}

# TA Response

Hello! At first glance the issue your having is coming from finding the 'input.txt' file. A few things you could try is making sure youre in the right directory using 'pwd', then ls to see if your directory is where your file is at. If the file is somewhere else, in your code include its absolute path.

If this doesn't work reply to this post, good luck!
